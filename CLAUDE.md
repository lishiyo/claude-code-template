# Project Guidelines for Claude

This is a skeleton/template for creating new projects in Claude Code.

## MANDATORY FIRST STEPS - READ BEFORE ANY TASK

ðŸ›‘ **STOP**: Before starting ANY task, you MUST:

1. âœ… **Read and understand** `memory-bank/reference/WORKFLOW.md`
2. âœ… **Read and understand** `memory-bank/reference/CONVENTIONS.md`
3. âœ… **Confirm** which workflow phase you're starting with (Understanding/Planning/Implementation/Validation)
4. âœ… **Create or update** your todo list using TodoWrite tool
5. âœ… **State explicitly** that you've read the required files

**If you skip these steps, STOP immediately and read them now.**

## Project Context

See `memory-bank/prd.md` for our PRD. This template provides a structured foundation for AI-assisted development projects with clear documentation, task tracking, and quality standards.

## Documentation Standards

See `memory-bank/reference/CONVENTIONS.md` for documentation standards and conventions. You MUST read this file.

## Project-Specific Rules

- **Small, incremental changes**: Make the smallest reasonable changes to achieve the desired outcome
- **Documentation first**: All code must have clear purpose statements and be documented before implementation
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests first, then implement features
- **No shortcuts**: Follow the complete workflow even for small tasks
- **Quality gates**: Code must pass linting, type checking, and tests before marking tasks complete

## Development Workflow

### CRITICAL: Always Follow the Workflow

**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK**: You MUST follow the workflow defined in `memory-bank/reference/WORKFLOW.md`:
1. Create task subfolder in `memory-bank/tasks/[task-id]/` (e.g., `2-1-baml-foundation`)
2. Document research in the task subfolder's `research.md`
3. Create implementation plan with todos in `plan.md`
4. Get user approval before implementing
5. Track progress and update todos during implementation
6. Create `audit.md` for post-implementation review when requested, this will be another agent's audit of your work, you may have to fix something
7. Create `handoff.md` in the task subfolder following `memory-bank/reference/HANDOFF_GUIDELINES.md`

**NEVER skip this workflow** - it's critical for project organization and tracking.

### Task Implementation
1. Read the full task description in `docs/implementation_plan.md`
2. Check dependencies in `tasks/roadmap.md`
3. Update task status in roadmap when starting/completing
4. Follow the directory structure defined in `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md`

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests required**: All functions/methods must have unit tests with >90% coverage
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **Test first**: Write failing tests before implementing functionality
- **Run tests frequently**: Execute tests after each logical change
- **Test commands**: Use `npm test` or project-specific test commands (document in this file if different)

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: Code must pass linting with zero warnings (`npm run lint` or equivalent)
- **Type checking**: All TypeScript/typed code must pass type checking
- **No debug code**: Remove console.logs, debugger statements, and commented code before committing
- **Follow existing patterns**: Match the style and conventions of surrounding code
- **Code reviews**: All significant changes require review (use audit.md process)

## Memory Bank Organization

```text
memory-bank/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/               # Core project documentation
  |-- architecture/     # Architecture overview and ADRs
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/              # Task tracking and implementation workspace
â””â”€â”€ reference/          # Standards, schemas, decisions, workflow
```

**Key Files:**
- `memory-bank/reference/WORKFLOW.md` - How to implement tasks
- `memory-bank/reference/data_schemas.md` - All data structure definitions
- `memory-bank/docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md` - system design, ADR logs in `decision-records` subfolder
- `memory-bank/reference/TESTING.md` - Testing standards and patterns

## Parallel Development Guidelines

### When Multiple Agents Work Together

- **Clear handoffs**: Use handoff.md files to communicate context between agents
- **Shared task tracking**: Update roadmap.md when tasks are started/completed
- **Avoid conflicts**: Coordinate on files being modified simultaneously
- **Document decisions**: Record architectural decisions in decision-records/

### Critical Dependencies

- **Task dependencies**: Check tasks/roadmap.md before starting work
- **File dependencies**: Verify architecture/OVERVIEW.md for component relationships
- **External dependencies**: Document in prd.md and keep updated
- **Testing dependencies**: Ensure test environment is properly configured

## Error Handling Priorities

- **User-facing errors**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
- **System errors**: Log with sufficient context for debugging
- **Graceful degradation**: System should remain functional when non-critical components fail
- **Recovery strategies**: Document how to recover from common failure scenarios

## Success Metrics to Remember

- **Code quality**: Zero linting errors, passing tests, type safety
- **Documentation coverage**: All modules have purpose statements and key files are documented
- **Task completion**: All todo items marked complete, audit passed
- **User experience**: Features work as specified in PRD and meet acceptance criteria

## When in Doubt

1. Check the PRD first (`docs/prd.md`)
2. Review architecture overview and decisions (`docs/architecture/` files)
3. Follow the parallel execution strategy (`tasks/roadmap.md`)
4. Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
