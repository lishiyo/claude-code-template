# Implementation Plan: User Authentication

**Parallel-Safe:** No (touches core middleware and database schema)
**Blocks:** Any user-specific features, authorization features
**Blocked By:** Database setup, basic Express server setup
**Touches Files:**
- `src/middleware/auth.ts` (new)
- `src/models/User.ts` (new)
- `src/routes/auth.ts` (new)
- `src/types/auth.ts` (new)
- `tests/auth/` (new directory)
- `package.json` (dependencies)

## Understanding

### Current State
- Express server running with basic route structure
- TypeScript configured with strict mode
- Jest testing framework set up
- No authentication or user management exists
- Database not yet configured

### Requirements
- JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing
- User registration and login endpoints
- Protected route middleware
- Session management with configurable expiration
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)

### Key Constraints/Patterns Found
- All existing code uses TypeScript with strict typing
- Error handling follows consistent pattern with custom error classes
- Middleware uses Express standard patterns
- Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Code organization separates models, routes, middleware, and types

## Plan

### Implementation Approach
1. **Database Layer**: Create User model with proper typing
2. **Security Layer**: Implement password hashing with bcrypt
3. **JWT Layer**: Token generation, validation, and middleware
4. **API Layer**: Registration and login endpoints
5. **Middleware Layer**: Route protection middleware
6. **Testing Layer**: Comprehensive test coverage

### What we're NOT doing (scope boundaries)
- ❌ Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- ❌ Email verification
- ❌ Password reset functionality
- ❌ Role-based permissions (just basic auth)
- ❌ Rate limiting (separate feature)
- ❌ Advanced session management (refresh tokens)

## Todos

### Phase 1: Dependencies and Types
- [ ] Install required dependencies (bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, @types versions)
- [ ] Create TypeScript types for User, AuthRequest, JWT payload
- [ ] Set up database connection and User model
- [ ] Create custom error classes for auth-specific errors

### Phase 2: Core Auth Logic
- [ ] Implement password hashing utility functions
- [ ] Create JWT token generation and validation functions
- [ ] Build User model with save/find methods
- [ ] Create authentication middleware for protected routes

### Phase 3: API Endpoints
- [ ] Build POST /auth/register endpoint with validation
- [ ] Build POST /auth/login endpoint with error handling
- [ ] Build POST /auth/logout endpoint (if using session approach)
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for auth utilities (hashing, JWT)
- [ ] Write unit tests for User model methods
- [ ] Write integration tests for auth endpoints
- [ ] Write middleware tests for route protection
- [ ] Test error cases and edge conditions

### Phase 5: Documentation and Quality
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public functions
- [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints
- [ ] Run linting and fix any issues
- [ ] Verify type checking passes
- [ ] Update project README with auth setup instructions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can register with email/password
- [ ] User can login and receive JWT token
- [ ] Protected routes reject unauthenticated requests
- [ ] Protected routes accept valid JWT tokens
- [ ] Passwords are properly hashed (never stored plain text)
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover all endpoints
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or linting warnings
- [ ] Error responses are consistent and helpful

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions
- **JWT over sessions**: Chosen for stateless approach, easier scaling
- **bcrypt over alternatives**: Industry standard, well-tested
- **Middleware approach**: Consistent with existing Express patterns
- **Separate types file**: Maintains TypeScript organization standards

### Security Considerations
- Salt rounds for bcrypt: 12 (good balance of security/performance)
- JWT secret: Must be environment variable, never hardcoded
- Token expiration: 24 hours default, configurable
- Input validation: Sanitize all user inputs before processing

### Integration Points
- User model will extend base Model class (when created)
- Auth middleware will integrate with existing error handling
- JWT validation will work with existing request/response types
- Tests will follow existing test organization in tests/ directory

### Potential Issues
- **Database setup dependency**: Need to choose and configure database first
- **Environment configuration**: JWT secret and database connection needed
- **CORS considerations**: May need to configure for frontend integration
- **Error message consistency**: Must match existing error response format
