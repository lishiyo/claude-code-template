# Research: Example User Authentication Feature

**Task ID**: 0-example-feature
**Phase**: Understanding
**Started**: 2024-01-15

## Research Questions

1. What authentication patterns exist in the current codebase?
2. What external libraries are already available?
3. What are the security requirements?
4. How do users currently access the system?

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Authentication
- **Current approach**: No authentication system exists
- **User management**: No user persistence
- **Session handling**: No session management
- **Security measures**: No current security implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (confirmed via package.json)
- **Database**: Not yet determined - PostgreSQL preferred
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (confirmed in src/ directory)
- **Testing**: Jest configured (confirmed via package.json scripts)

### Dependencies Available
- `bcrypt` - Not installed, would need to add for password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken` - Not installed, would need to add for JWT tokens
- `express-session` - Not installed, alternative session approach

## Requirements Gathered

### Functional Requirements
- Users must be able to register with email/password
- Users must be able to log in and maintain sessions
- Users must be able to log out securely
- System must protect authenticated routes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Passwords must be hashed (never stored in plain text)
- Sessions must expire after reasonable timeouts
- Must integrate with existing Express middleware pattern
- Must follow existing TypeScript patterns in codebase

## External Research

### Security Best Practices
- OWASP authentication guidelines reviewed
- JWT vs session-based authentication trade-offs considered
- Password strength requirements researched

### Library Comparison
| Library | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| Passport.js | Full-featured, many strategies | Heavy for simple use case | Skip for now |
| JWT + bcrypt | Lightweight, stateless | Manual implementation needed | âœ… Choose |
| express-session | Built-in Express support | Requires session store | Consider later |

## Key Findings

1. **No existing auth patterns** - We're starting from scratch, can establish good patterns
2. **Middleware approach preferred** - Existing codebase uses middleware pattern extensively
3. **TypeScript integration essential** - All existing code is typed, must continue this pattern
4. **Testing coverage required** - Existing test patterns expect >90% coverage

## Unknowns/Questions for User

1. **Session duration**: How long should user sessions last?
2. **Registration flow**: Should email verification be required?
3. **Password requirements**: What password complexity rules?
4. **Database choice**: PostgreSQL vs SQLite for initial implementation?

## Next Steps

Based on this research, ready to move to Planning phase with:
- JWT-based authentication approach
- bcrypt for password hashing
- TypeScript integration throughout
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration with existing Express patterns
