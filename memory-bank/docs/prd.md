# Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: [Replace with actual project name]
**Type**: Claude Code Template/Skeleton
**Purpose**: Provides a structured foundation for AI-assisted development projects

### Problem Statement

Developers and AI assistants need a consistent project structure and workflow to:
- Maintain clear documentation and task tracking

- Ensure quality standards and testing requirements
- Support parallel development and collaboration

### Solution

A comprehensive project template with:
- Structured documentation in memory-bank/
- Clear workflow guidelines for AI agents
- Task tracking and handoff protocols
- Quality checklists and validation steps

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **AI Development Assistants** (Claude, etc.) - Following structured workflows
- **Developers** - Using AI assistants for code projects
- **Teams** - Collaborating on projects with AI assistance

### Use Cases
1. **New Project Setup** - Start projects with established patterns
2. **AI-Assisted Development** - Guide AI agents through structured workflows
3. **Team Handoffs** - Transfer knowledge between developers and AI
4. **Quality Assurance** - Ensure consistent standards across implementations

## Functional Requirements
