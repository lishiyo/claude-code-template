# Session Handoff Guidelines

This document defines the standard format for handoff.md files to ensure smooth transitions between AI agents, coding sessions, and team members.

## Required Structure for Task Handoffs

Every active task MUST maintain a handoff.md with these sections:

### 1. Session Log (append, don't overwrite)
- Session timestamp
- What was attempted
- What was completed
- What was blocked/failed

### 2. Current State (overwrite each session)
- Which files were modified
- What's working/tested
- What's broken/untested

### 3. Next Session Setup
- Exact files to include in context
- Specific next steps (be explicit!)
- Known gotchas/warnings

## Example Template

---
## Session: [DATE TIME]

### Completed
- [ ] List actual changes made
- [ ] Include file paths and line numbers for modifications

### Attempted but Blocked
- Issue: [what went wrong]
- Why: [root cause if known]

### Modified Files
- `path/to/file.js` - Added authentication middleware (lines 23-47)
- `path/to/other.js` - Updated imports only

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Auth middleware compiles
- ‚ùå Tests failing: `auth.test.js` line 34 - missing mock
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardcoded secret in config.js line 12

### Next Session Must
1. Fix the failing test by adding mock for `jwt.sign`
2. Move hardcoded secret to .env
3. Continue with route protection (see implementation.md section 3)

### Context for Next Session
Include these files in this order:
1. This handoff file
2. `src/auth/middleware.js`
3. `tests/auth.test.js`
4. `.env.example`

## Parallel Work Coordination

If your task might conflict with another active task:

1. List your "claimed" files at session start
2. Check other active tasks' HANDOFF.md files
3. Note any coordination needed

## Quality Guidelines

### Be Specific and Actionable

‚ùå **Bad**: "Authentication works"
‚úÖ **Good**: "JWT authentication implemented with login/register endpoints returning valid tokens"

### Include Testing Instructions

Every handoff must include:
- **Manual testing steps** with exact commands/URLs
- **Expected results** for each test
- **Automated test commands** to verify functionality

### Document Blockers Clearly

When blocked:
- State the specific issue
- Explain what was tried
- List what's needed to proceed
- Provide enough context for help

## Common Handoff Types

### ‚úÖ Completed Task
Focus on: How to verify, what's deployable, future enhancements

### üöß In-Progress Task
Focus on: Current progress, immediate next steps, any blockers

### ‚ùå Blocked Task
Focus on: What's blocking, what help is needed, work ready to continue

## Integration with Project Files

When writing handoffs, also update:
- `tasks/roadmap.md` with task status changes
- `docs/changelog.md` with significant changes
- Related documentation affected by implementation

**Remember**: Good handoff documentation enables immediate productivity for the next person (AI or human).
